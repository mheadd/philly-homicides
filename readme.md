## Visualizing Homicides in Philadelphia

This is a demo application that uses [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/), [Torque](https://github.com/CartoDB/torque) and crime incident data from the [City of Philadelphia](http://opendataphilly.org/opendata/resource/215/philadelphia-police-part-one-crime-incidents/).

It was built at a [Code for Philly](http://codeforphilly.org/) civic application workshop by [Mark Headd](http://twitter.com/mheadd).

The visualization displays crime incidents categorized as homicides from January 1, 2006 through December 18, 2012 (almost seven full years totalling 3,084 homicides).
